## 2. Architecture Design Comparison

**Apache Pulsar** adopts a layered architecture, including three core components: Broker (stateless compute layer), BookKeeper (distributed storage layer), and ZooKeeper (metadata management). Built on Java/JVM, it has mature enterprise-grade features, but numerous components lead to complex architecture and high operational costs. Pulsar uses a single Pulsar native protocol, with support for Kafka, MQTT, and AMQP requiring additional plugins (KoP, MoP, AoP). Pulsar provides mature multi-tenant isolation mechanisms (Tenant and Namespace) and a complete ecosystem toolchain (Pulsar Functions, Pulsar SQL), suitable for large enterprise complex scenarios.

**RobustMQ** also adopts a layered decoupled architecture, but with relatively simple components: Broker Server (compute layer), Meta Service (Raft-based metadata management), and Journal Server (storage layer). Built with Rust, leveraging Rust's memory safety, zero-cost abstraction, and high-performance features to achieve zero GC and low resource consumption. Single-binary deployment, with no external dependencies, no need for ZooKeeper. RobustMQ natively supports multiple protocols (MQTT, Kafka, AMQP), no additional plugins needed, one deployment supports multiple protocols. The storage layer adopts a pluggable design, supporting multiple backends such as memory, SSD, and S3. RobustMQ's architectural design pursues simplification and lightweight, suitable for cloud-native and resource-constrained scenarios.
