## 3. Core Features & Characteristics Comparison

**NATS** features extreme simplicity and high performance. Core NATS provides three modes: pub/sub, request-response, and queue subscription, with message delivery being pure in-memory, extremely low latency (microsecond level). Flexible message routing is achieved through topic wildcards (`*` and `>`). After JetStream was introduced, it provides message persistence, message replay, consumer management, message acknowledgment and other features, supporting "at least once" and "exactly once" semantics. NATS advantages include simple deployment (single binary, no dependencies), excellent performance (sub-millisecond latency), low operational cost (self-healing cluster). NATS main challenges include: uses proprietary protocol, migrating from existing systems requires rewriting clients; compared to Kafka/Pulsar, JetStream's stream processing capabilities are relatively basic; single protocol limits applicability in multi-scenario use.

**RobustMQ** features multi-protocol unification, achieving MQTT, Kafka, AMQP and other protocols within a single system, using standard open-source SDKs to ensure protocol compatibility. Implements compute-storage separation, allowing independent scaling of Broker and Storage; pluggable storage supporting memory, SSD, S3, HDFS and other backends. The project is implemented in Rust, achieving zero GC and predictable latency. Provides over 8 data integration connectors (Kafka/Pulsar/MySQL/MongoDB, etc.), supporting complex data workflow orchestration. Optimized for AI scenarios, including AI training pipelines, real-time inference, and multi-modal data processing. Offers complete cloud-native support including single-binary deployment, Kubernetes Operator, Helm charts, and Serverless architecture. RobustMQ's advantages are multi-protocol unified management, reduced operational complexity; compute-storage separation architecture enabling elastic scaling; zero GC, low resource consumption. Its main challenges include: the project is in active development, some advanced features are being implemented; the community size is smaller compared to NATS; production case accumulation is ongoing.

## 6. Applicable Scenarios Comparison

**Selection Recommendations**

**NATS** is suitable for scenarios pursuing extreme simplicity and high performance, especially microservices communication, edge computing, and service mesh. Single-binary, no-dependency deployment model makes it very convenient for cloud-native scenarios. Core NATS is suitable for scenarios requiring extremely low latency, while JetStream is suitable for scenarios requiring message persistence and replay. However, migrating from existing Kafka/MQTT systems requires rewriting client code, suitable for new projects or scenarios accepting NATS protocol.

**RobustMQ** is suitable for production environments requiring multi-protocol support, particularly enterprises operating MQTT, Kafka, AMQP and other systems simultaneously. The compute-storage separation architecture and pluggable storage make it adaptable from edge to cloud, suitable for enterprises requiring flexible scaling. Additionally, RobustMQ's data integration capabilities make it suitable for IoT data pipelines and AI training scenarios.

| Scenario | NATS | RobustMQ |
|------|------|----------|
| **Microservices Messaging** | Simple deployment, low latency, suitable | Suitable, supports multi-protocol |
| **Edge Computing** | Single binary, low resource consumption, suitable | Suitable, supports pluggable storage |
| **IoT Platform** | Requires custom integration | Native MQTT support, direct use |
| **Streaming Analytics** | JetStream basic support | Suitable, supports connectors and AI workflows |

## 7. Migration Cost Comparison

**Migration Recommendations**

**Migrating from Kafka/RabbitMQ/MQTT to NATS** requires rewriting client code (SDK replacement) and protocol adaptation. Kafka Connect/RabbitMQ plugins cannot be directly used, requiring custom data integration. Suitable for new projects or scenarios willing to invest in complete system refactoring.

**Migrating from Kafka/RabbitMQ/MQTT to RobustMQ** can reuse existing client SDKs (for MQTT/Kafka/AMQP), requiring minimal code changes. The multi-protocol architecture supports gradual migration, avoiding system interruptions caused by one-time switchovers. Pluggable storage allows retaining existing storage solutions, suitable for enterprises with high system stability requirements.

| Migration Path | Complexity | Cost | Risk |
|------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Kafka → NATS** | High | High (rewrite client) | High |
| **RabbitMQ → NATS** | High | High (protocol adaptation) | High |
| **MQTT → NATS** | High | High (custom integration) | High |
| **Kafka → RobustMQ** | Low | Low (reuse SDK) | Low |
| **RabbitMQ → RobustMQ** | Low | Low (AMQP compatibility) | Low |
| **MQTT → RobustMQ** | Low | Low (native support) | Low |
