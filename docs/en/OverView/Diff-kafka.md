# RobustMQ vs Apache Kafka Comparison

> **Core Difference**: Apache Kafka is a mature distributed streaming platform with a rich ecosystem and extensive production validation, focusing on high-throughput log aggregation and real-time data pipelines. RobustMQ, as an emerging cloud-native message middleware, focuses on multi-protocol unification (MQTT/Kafka/AMQP/RocketMQ) and minimalist deployment, implemented in Rust with zero GC and low resource consumption, providing a simpler architecture and lower operational complexity.

Apache Kafka and RobustMQ are both modern message queue systems, but differ significantly in design philosophy and target scenarios. Kafka is the industry's most mature distributed streaming platform, developed by LinkedIn and open-sourced, implemented in Scala/Java, providing high-throughput log aggregation and stream processing capabilities with a Broker + ZooKeeper architecture. Kafka has a rich ecosystem (Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams, KSQL) and extensive production validation. RobustMQ focuses on multi-protocol unification and cloud-native scenarios, implemented in Rust, leveraging Rust's memory safety, zero-cost abstraction, and concurrency performance advantages to provide zero GC and low resource consumption. Single-binary deployment with no external dependencies makes deployment extremely simple. This document provides a detailed comparison of their positioning, architecture, features, and applicable scenarios.

## 1. Positioning & Strategic Goals

**Apache Kafka** is positioned as a distributed streaming platform, open-sourced by LinkedIn in 2011 and now an Apache top-level project. Kafka focuses on high-throughput log aggregation, real-time data pipelines, and stream processing. Implemented in Scala/Java, it provides distributed message storage and stream processing capabilities with a Broker + ZooKeeper architecture (version 3.0+ supports KRaft mode to remove ZooKeeper). Kafka adopts partition and replica mechanisms, supporting horizontal scaling and high availability. It provides a rich ecosystem: Kafka Connect (data integration), Kafka Streams (stream processing), KSQL (streaming SQL). Widely used for big data pipelines, log collection, real-time analytics, and event-driven architectures.

**RobustMQ** is positioned as a cloud-native, multi-protocol unified message middleware. The project is implemented in Rust, leveraging Rust's memory safety, zero-cost abstraction, and concurrency performance advantages to achieve zero GC and low resource consumption. RobustMQ's core goal is to solve the protocol fragmentation problem by supporting MQTT, Kafka, AMQP, RocketMQ and other protocols in a single system, eliminating the complexity of maintaining multiple message queue systems. Single-binary deployment with no external dependencies makes deployment extremely simple. The layered architecture design enables independent scaling of compute and storage layers, while pluggable storage supports flexible adaptation from edge to cloud scenarios. RobustMQ is suitable for IoT platforms, microservices communication, and AI data pipelines.

## 2. Architecture Design Comparison

**Apache Kafka** adopts a Broker + ZooKeeper architecture (version 3.0+ supports KRaft mode). Brokers are responsible for message storage and services, while ZooKeeper (or KRaft) handles metadata management and coordination. Adopts partition and replica mechanisms, with each topic divided into multiple partitions, and each partition having multiple replicas distributed across different Brokers. Messages are stored on local disks, using sequential writes to optimize throughput. Compute and storage are tightly coupled, requiring expansion of both storage and compute resources when scaling. Kafka uses a pull model, where consumers actively pull messages, supporting consumer groups for load balancing.

**RobustMQ** adopts a layered decoupled architecture, completely separating Broker, Meta Service, and Journal Server to achieve compute-storage separation and independent scaling. The project is implemented in Rust, leveraging Rust's memory safety, zero-cost abstraction, and concurrency performance advantages to achieve zero GC and low resource consumption. Single-binary deployment with no external dependencies makes deployment extremely simple. Native support for multiple standard protocols such as MQTT, Kafka, and AMQP, using community standard SDKs, ensures zero migration cost. The storage layer adopts a pluggable design, supporting multiple backends such as memory, SSD, and S3, meeting different performance and cost requirements. Raft consensus-based metadata management provides complete distributed capabilities, including automatic failover and elastic scaling. RobustMQ is specifically designed for cloud-native scenarios, providing Kubernetes Operator and Serverless support.
